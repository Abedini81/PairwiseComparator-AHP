# PairwiseComparator-AHP

**PairwiseComparator-AHP** is a Python-based application that simplifies decision-making using the **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)**. This tool features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, enabling users to define decision criteria, perform pairwise comparisons, and compute the relative importance (weights) of each criterion.

## Features

- **Intuitive GUI**: User-friendly interface for defining criteria and entering pairwise comparisons.
- **Matrix Normalization**: Automatically normalizes pairwise comparison matrices.
- **Weight Calculation**: Computes the relative importance of each criterion.
- **Dynamic Outputs**: Displays the comparison matrix, normalized matrix, and computed weights in real-time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
